Behavior :

At first, the "main" group will be created and the "Elegance/primary" part will be swallowed by the "Elegance/menu" group.
All swallowed parts from "Elegance/menu" will be set depending on the available categories at startup .
Then the signal "Elegance/primary,set" will be sent to the "main" group so it can show the screen, then it should send
the signal "Elegance/primary,set,end" to notify the app that the animation is done and the primary screen is shown.
Then the signal "Elegance/menu,init" will be sent to notify the group to start any initialization, then it will wait to receive
the signal "Elegance/menu,ready" at which point it will send the signal "Elegance/menu,category_set,reset" and
the signal "Elegance/menu,category_unset,reset" to the group with the source of the emission set to the part name's suffix
that is set or unset ("before_0" will be sent for part "Elegance/menu/category.before_0" for example) to reflect that status.

This is to allow you to do an animation or splash screen at bootup. Since non-swallowed parts will appear invisble,
you can assume that all the parts are 'set', until you receive the "Elegance/menu_category_set,reset" and
"Elegance/menu/category_unset,reset" signals. Note that these two signals (the ',reset' variants) should be instantenuous, so
the user shouldn't notice that they happened. It will only allow you to have a better animation if later a new category
is added and the "Elegance/menu/category_set" signal is sent for it.

The item parts of a category will be swallowed then the "Elegance/menu/category,selected" signal will be sent to the
selected category. You can assume that all are items are 'set' at that point. Once the animation is done, you should
send the "Elegance/menu/category,selected,end" signal, at which point the "Elegance/menu/category,item_set,reset"
and "Elegance/menu/category,item_unset,reset" signals will be sent for each item.

There you go, the menu is finally appearing and you are ready to handle user events!
At this point, the user can either scroll the categories or the items, for both, the behavior is the same, you will
receive the signal "*_next" or "*_previous" to create the scrolling, once you are done, you should send the associated
",end" signal. Elegance will then send the unswallow and swallow the parts properly to reflect the scroll then it will
send the signal "*_reset" to reset the screen as it should be, and send the "*_set,reset" and "*_unset,reset" signals.
This next,end->swallow->unswallow->reset->set,reset+unset,reset chain of events should happen instantenuously so that the
user does not perceive it and only sees the actual scrolling animation.
In the case of categories, the selected one will also receive a "*,category_unselected" signal and the next/previous one
will receive the "*,category_selected" signal. After the "*,category_selected,end" signal is received, the
 "*item_set,reset" and "*item_unset,reset" will be called to put the items in a consistent state.
There will never be a item_set/item_unset or item_set,reset/item_unset,reset signals when the category is not selected.
