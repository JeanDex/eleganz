At first, the "main" group will be created and the "FLHOC" part will be swallowed by the "FLHOC" group.
All swallowed parts will be set according to the current status, then the mainloop will run (load/show signals will be sent). Then FLHOC will wait for the "FLHOC/ready" signal from edje before processing input events.
After the "FLHOC/ready" signal is received, FLHOC will send the proper signals to represent the state (selected, set, unset) to swallowed parts.
This is to allow you to do an animation with the final status of the xmb at bootup (since swallowed parts that are empty will not appear, you can assume all are 'set').
A new category/item will be swallowed before sending the "*_set" signal to the corresponding part.
Any signal with the source set to "forward" will be forwarded to the underlying swallowed objects
